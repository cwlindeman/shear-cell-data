Data for "Multi-dimensional memory in sheared granular materials"

trackParticlesAndStrains.py allows you to plot the strains and 
 values associated with configurations during readout. Comment in the line corresponding to the type of data you want to see and then run the code in the same file as all the data (folders with the format year-month-day-letter).

Also included are the ImageJ scripts used to analyze the particle and box positions, along with a sample tiff stack for 24-05-28-a-readout
